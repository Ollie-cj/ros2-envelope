# Safety Considerations for Haptic Safety Envelope System

## Deterministic Scheduling

In safety-critical systems like our haptic safety envelope, deterministic timing is essential to guarantee that safety checks are performed within the required time constraints (< 10 ms in our case). Key considerations include:

### Real-time Operating System (RTOS)
- The safety envelope should ideally run on an RTOS that provides deterministic scheduling guarantees
- For ROS2, this means using the RTOS-compatible middleware (rmw_cyclonedds_cpp or rmw_fastrtps_cpp with real-time tuning)
- The microcontroller implementation should use a real-time kernel or bare-metal programming with deterministic timing

### Priority-based Scheduling
- The safety envelope process should be assigned the highest priority in the system
- Use of priority inheritance protocols to prevent priority inversion
- Avoid non-deterministic operations (dynamic memory allocation, I/O operations) in the critical path

### Execution Time Analysis
- Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis must be performed on all safety-critical functions
- Static code analysis tools should be used to verify timing constraints
- Performance metrics (as implemented in our code) should continuously monitor processing times

### Interrupt Handling
- Interrupt service routines (ISRs) should be kept minimal and deterministic
- Critical sections should be protected with appropriate synchronization mechanisms
- Interrupt latency should be measured and documented

## Watchdog Mechanisms

Watchdogs are essential for detecting system failures and ensuring fail-safe operation. Our implementation includes:

### Software Watchdog
- Monitors the arrival of pose messages and triggers safety stop if communication is lost
- Periodically checks system health and publishes safety signals
- Implements timeout detection for all critical operations

### Hardware Watchdog Recommendations
- External hardware watchdog timer (WDT) should be implemented on the microcontroller
- The WDT should require periodic refreshing from the safety check process
- If the safety check process fails to refresh the WDT, it should trigger an emergency stop

### Fault Detection and Recovery
- The system should implement fault detection for sensor failures, communication errors, and processing delays
- Graceful degradation strategies should be implemented where possible
- All fault conditions should trigger appropriate safety responses

## IEC 62304 Artifacts

IEC 62304 is a standard for medical device software lifecycle processes. For our safety envelope system, the following artifacts should be maintained:

### Software Development Plan
- Documentation of software development lifecycle processes
- Risk management procedures and documentation
- Configuration management and change control procedures

### Software Requirements Specification
- Functional requirements (boundary checking, response time, etc.)
- Safety requirements (fail-safe behavior, watchdog mechanisms, etc.)
- Performance requirements (< 10 ms processing time)
- Interface requirements (ROS2 topics, message formats, etc.)

### Software Architecture
- System decomposition into software items
- Interfaces between software items
- Hardware-software interfaces
- Third-party software components

### Software Detailed Design
- Algorithms for boundary checking
- Data structures for representing boundaries
- Timing diagrams for critical operations
- State machines for system behavior

### Software Verification and Validation
- Unit test plans and results
- Integration test plans and results
- System test plans and results
- Traceability matrix linking requirements to tests

### Risk Management File
- Hazard identification and risk analysis
- Risk control measures
- Verification of risk control measures
- Residual risk evaluation

### Software Maintenance Plan
- Procedures for monitoring and responding to issues
- Procedures for implementing updates
- Validation procedures for updates

## Implementation Considerations for < 10 ms Response Time

To achieve the required < 10 ms response time for safety checks:

1. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: We've implemented a simple and efficient AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) check that has O(1) complexity.

2. **Memory Management**: All data structures are pre-allocated to avoid dynamic memory allocation during critical operations.

3. **Lock-Free Algorithms**: Where possible, lock-free algorithms are used to avoid mutex contention.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors processing time and logs warnings if the 10 ms threshold is exceeded.

5. **Optimized Message Handling**: The ROS2 QoS settings are configured for real-time performance with appropriate reliability and deadline settings.

6. **Microcontroller Implementation**: For the microcontroller stub, the boundary check algorithm should be implemented in a bare-metal environment or with a minimal RTOS to ensure deterministic timing.
