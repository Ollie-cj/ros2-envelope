/**
 * @file safety_envelope.hpp
 * @brief Header file for the safety envelope point inclusion testing system
 * 
 * This file contains the declarations for a system that tests whether a point
 * (such as a robot tooltip position) is inside a defined safety envelope.
 * The safety envelope represents a boundary that the robot should not cross
 * during operation to ensure safe interaction with its environment.
 * 
 * Features to be implemented:
 * - Definition of safety envelope boundaries
 * - Point inclusion testing algorithms
 * - Safety violation detection and handling
 * - Visualization helpers for debugging
 * 
 * This system will help prevent the robot tooltip from leaving the designated
 * safe operational area, enhancing operational safety.
