/**
 * @file safety_envelope.cpp
 * @brief Implementation file for the safety envelope point inclusion testing system
 * 
 * This file implements the functionality for testing whether a point
 * (such as a robot tooltip position) is inside a defined safety envelope.
 * 
 * The implementation will include:
 * - Geometric algorithms for point-in-polygon testing
 * - Distance calculations from points to envelope boundaries
 * - Safety margin enforcement
 * - Real-time performance optimizations
 * 
 * This system is designed to work with ROS2 to integrate with robotic systems
 * and prevent the robot tooltip from leaving the designated safe operational area.
